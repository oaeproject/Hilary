/**
 * A message object for messages contained within a message box.
 *
 * ## threadKey
 *
 *  The threadKey of a message is a formatted string that describes its reply depth hierarchy. The format of the string
 *  is in the way it is in order to string-sort messages such that messages that are deeper replies have less sorting
 *  precedence over their ancestors. Basically, it means when sorting for paging, a message will always come before its
 *  replies, and its replies will always come immediately after their parents / grandparents. For example, the threadKey
 *  for these messages (in order that they would be string-sorted):
 *
 *      MessageA:   <timestampA>|
 *      MessageB:   <timestampA>#<timestampB>|
 *      MessageC:   <timestampA>#<timestampB>#<timestampC>|
 *      MessageB1:  <timestampA>#<timestampB1>|
 *
 *      timestampA describes a timestamp of millis since the epoch (e.g., 123456789).
 *
 *  In this scenario:
 *
 *      * MessageA is a top-level message; and
 *      * MessageB is a reply to MessageA; and
 *      * MessageB1 is a reply to MessageA, but was posted after MessageB and *before* MessageC; and
 *      * MessageC is a reply to MessageB.
 *
 *  The threadKey sorting scheme ensures that MessageC appeared before MessageB1, even though MessageB1 was posted
 *  before MessageC.
 *
 * @param  {String}         id              The id of the message. This id is a compound key of the messageBoxId and the created timestamp of a message in the format: `<messageBoxId>#<created>`
 * @param  {String}         messageBoxId    The id of the message box in which this message is contained, ex: d:cam:dfjOSdfij#discussion would be an example of the messagebox for a discussion thread with id d:cam:dfjOSdfij.
 * @param  {String}         threadKey       The "thread key", which is a formatted string that describes the reply depth hierarchy of this message. See summary for more information.
 * @param  {String}         body            The content of the message
 * @param  {String}         createdBy       The id of the user who created the message
 * @param  {String|Number}  created         The timestamp (millis since the epoch) when the message was created
 * @param  {Number}         level           The depth of the message (e.g., top-level message is 0, reply to a top-level message is 1, etc...)
 * @param  {String}         [replyTo]       The id of the message to which this message is a reply, if any
 * @param  {Number}         [deleted]       If the message is soft-deleted, this value will hold the timestamp (millis since the epoch) that it was deleted
