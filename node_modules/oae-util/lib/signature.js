/**
 * Creates a signature that is valid for an approximate amount of time. This signature method trades off a precise
 * expiry time to allow for a signature that is "stable" within a range of time and produces signatures that are
 * useful for caching in URLs. To control the range of time the signature is valid, the following options are
 * available:
 *
 *  * `duration`: This defines the range of time in which the signature will change. If you set this to 15 minutes,
 *    the signature will change exactly every 15 minutes. This is important to take into consideration when tuning
 *    the signature for caching resources in a URL. However, the longer the duration is, the less frequently the
 *    signature will expire. So for situations where you are generating important keys for authentication, cache
 *    doesn't matter and you can set a smaller duration. For things like thumbnail URL access, a longer duration
 *    can be used to optimize caching in a URL
 *
 *  * `offset`: This can be thought of as the "minimum" amount of time the signature will be valid. It will be the
 *    amount of time added to the signature after the range of time in the duration rolls over.
 *
 * The signature expiry date is calculated using a rolling expiry window based on the duration. If you use a duration
 * of 1 day, then acquiring a signature with a duration of 1 day implies that the signature will expire at the end of
 * the day. Therefore, if I get a signature with duration 1 day and no offset at 11:59:59pm, it will expire in 1
 * second!
 *
 * To alleviate the 1-second issue raised , there is the `offset`. If I get a signature at 11:59:59pm with an offset
 * of 1 hour, the signature will expire at 1:00:00am of the next day (i.e., 1 hour into the next day), and so the
 * signature will never expire less than an hour after it is issued.
 *
 * That said, these parameters give the following guarantees:
 *
 *  * The **minimum** time a signature will be valid for is what you provide as the `offset`
 *  * The **maximum** time a signature will be valid for is `duration + offset` seconds
 *
 * So those rules can be used to tweak the minimum and maximum duration of the signature.
 *
 * @param  {Object}     data        The data to sign. This data will be signed with a computed `_expiry` key to avoid tampering the expiry date
 * @param  {Number}     [duration]  The nominal number of seconds for which this signature is valid. See summary for more information. Default: 12 hours
 * @param  {Number}     [offset]    The minimum number of seconds for which this signature is valid. See summary for more information. Default: 12 hours
 * @return {Object}                 An object with a `signature` key that holds the signature and a `expires` key which holds the timestamp when the signature will expire.
