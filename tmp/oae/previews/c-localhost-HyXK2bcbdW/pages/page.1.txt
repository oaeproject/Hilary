Would like for us to go back to our institutional groups to decide what should actually be featured on these
pages.
Now "My Library" rather than "My Content" throughout the UI.
Left hand panel of recommended stuff is now an activity wall that updates constantly so users have
p. 2 Categories menu -- clicking on it would bring down a selection of stuff from the first tier of the
hierarchy. Would like to move the stuff in the directory page now as that stuff is already available on
institutions' websites.
John: generally likes the designs but not the content window controls. Better model is google where the
controls appear when you mouse over. Tags look a bit odd.
David: Agree it looks good. On p. 2, there are 10 boxes -- maybe go for fewer?
Recommended and related -- replaced with activity stream
This site, http://www.tumblr.com/explore , is the inspiration for the button on p.2 under show more
p. 28 -- not technically impossible to connect with a bibliographic tool -- could be a good side project.

BUT, technically difficult to do this for the 1.0 release.
p. 2: Question 1: Very focused on content -- is that the right focus for it?
John: It doesn't have to be content -- maybe that is all that's in there right now. Nico: Yes we can repurpose some of these boxes to show other features (like discussions).
Question 2: Categories button only shows top level of hierarchies. Is that okay?
-- hard to be sure without that button open for us.
p. 38: 1) recommended content on the hover -- more will show up throughout the system. How do we feel
about that?
