 * Stores a file body on the storage backend.

 * It's up to the caller to store this uri appropriately.
 *
 * @param  {String}      tenantAlias             The tenant alias where the request originated.
 * @param  {Object}      file                    An object that holds 4 data keys (`filename`, `path`, `mime` and `size`). This file should be removed once the file is stored or in case something goes wrong.
 * @param  {Object}      [options]               Set of options that might change how the backend should store the file.
 * @param  {String}      [options.resourceId]    When specified, the backend should only use this string to determine where (pathwise) the file should be stored. This allows the caller to overwrite certain files. (Profile pictures is an example of this.)
 * @param  {Function}    callback                A callback method
 * @param  {Object}      callback.err            An error object (if any)
