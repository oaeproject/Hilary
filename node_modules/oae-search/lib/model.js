/**
 * A model object that represents a set of search results that may be returned to the client from a search request.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * {
 *      "total": 27233,
 *      "results": [{ ... }, { ... }, ...]
 * }
 *
 * Note that "total" is the complete number of results in the search, and not the number of results in the `results` property
 * of the result object. The `results` property only represents the current page of results.
 *
 * @param  {Number}        total       The total number of results that match the request (not just in this page, in storage)
 * @param  {Object[]}      results     An array of documents that were returned from the search
 * @return {SearchResult}              An object that represents this search result
