 * Determine which visibility level of library the user in context should receive from the target library owner. The following
 * table presents a visibility matrix of how a feed would be issued for a group.
 *
 * Assume that Tenant A and B both have enabled tenant permeability and Tenant C has it disabled. The column headers defined the
 * status of the current user (whether he is anonymous, an authenticated user or if he's a member), the rows express the
 * visibility setting of the library owner. Each cell will then express which library stream should be returned. A `/` means
 * the user does not have access to the library
