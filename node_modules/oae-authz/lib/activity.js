         * activities, and we do not deliver invite activities to anyone but the recipient of the
         * email. This is an aggressive approach to ensure we don't leak email address to, for
         * example, members of groups.
         *
         * If we want to expand this propagation to allow activities containing email recipients to
         * be routed to larger audiences, the following must happen:
         *
         *  1.  The "id" of the entity (e.g., the entity id and the route id) MUST be changed to
         *      something that is a unique obfuscation of the email. For example, a sha1 hash salted
         *      by the domain would likely work (i.e., "mrvisser@gmail.com" ->
         *      "sha1('mrvisser@gmail.com')@gmail.com" -> "abcdefabcdef1234567890@gmail.com")
         *  2.  The "oae:email" field must always exist on the entity however for any user in
         *      context that is not the recipient of the email itself (or someone who does not have
         *      a verified email that is the email address itself), we use only the first character
         *      of the email username, followed by an ellipses (i.e., "mrvisser@gmail.com" ->
         *      "m...@gmail.com")
         *
         * Once the above 2 obfuscation approaches are taken, we should be able to expand this
         * propagation rule to ALL.
