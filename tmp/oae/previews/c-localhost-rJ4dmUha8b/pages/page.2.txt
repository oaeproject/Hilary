2) Public information: John -- this is where things are trending. MIT public directory and Cornell VIVO
project. Ability to make this public at least.
Jon: For UCB, it's about the individual's ability to make it public or not.
In zip files,
02LHN Long Name -- user's info was in a header that spanned the whole page; now it's been moved to
the left side. Which do people prefer?
The header action buttons used to have text in them to tell you what they do. Now they are buttons that
just show icons.
David: Buttons are fine if you provide rollover text. John: Also don't create buttons for things people don't
expect to find there.
Footer: We would like to start using the footer for useful things like navigation but we are uncertain what
to use it for.
John: Gaining popularity; not unexpected to find stuff at the bottom now. Wouldn't want us to be the first to
do this. Widely enough used now that it's not a big deal.
Alan: Amazon is an example.
Greg: how easy is it to customize the footer? We have a number of things we'd want to put in there.
Nico: It would be interesting to know so it could inform the design
John: the main thing we're contrasting this with is the cascading dropdowns across the top. It seems like
a slightly cleaner way of achieving the same thing. Key issue of how well it works is how often you need
to click on it. Best for infrequently clicked links -- a pain to have to scroll down to get to something you
have to click all the time.
Nico: Next week, progress report for Milestone 2 and milestone 1 remaining work. Clickable wireframe for
worlds.
Nico not available on Tuesday. Reschedule for Thursday April 14 at 5 pm.
