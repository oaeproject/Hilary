/**
 * Get the multipart file upload request parser middleware for Express. The middleware only has an effect if it
 * is of Content-Type "multipart/form-data". Once run, the request will contain the following properties:
 *
 *  * `req.body`  - The simple key-value fields that were part of the request, similar to a query string
 *  * `req.files` - Any file uploads that were included in the request body. The key will be the name of the
 *                  field that holds the file object. The file object has the keys:
 *
 *      * `req.files[key].name`   - The original filename (String) of the uploaded file (e.g., foo.docx)
 *      * `req.files[key].size`   - The size (Number) of the file in bytes
 *      * `req.files[key].path`   - The location on disk where the file is stored. You can use `fs.rename()`
 *                                  to relocate it to the appropriate location after processing
 *
 * @param  {Object}     [formOptions]               The form options for the multiparty form parser object
 * @param  {String}     [formOptions.uploadDir]     The temporary directory to use to store the uploaded file
