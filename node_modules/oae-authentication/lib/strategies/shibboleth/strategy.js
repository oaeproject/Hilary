         *  - Shib-Identity-Provider        :   The entityID of the IdP that authenticated the user associated with the request.
         *
         * Depending on what profile attributes the IdP releases, other headers might be in the request.
         * The Shibboleth SP can be configured to map certain attributes to request headers. Ideally, no mapping should happen
         * within OAE but in the shib software. See https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/SHIB2/NativeSPAttributeAccess
