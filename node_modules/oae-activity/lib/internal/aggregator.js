/**
 * Collect and process a certain amount of routed activities from the given bucket. This method is *not safe* in the sense
 * that it does not try and first acquire a lock on the bucket. Do not use this directly, instead use `collectBucket` which
 * in turn uses this method with locks.
 *
 * Collecting and processing activities in this method goes through the following steps:
 *
 *  1. Get the next batch of queued activities in the bucket. The number of activities processed is determined by `limit`.
 *
 *  2.  Expand the activities retrieved into all the potential "aggregate keys" that it could match. When expanding, a
 *      preliminary process of aggregation occurs where we collect aggregates within just the set of activities we
 *      fetched from the queue. See `createAggregates` for more information.
 *
 *  3.  Get the status of all aggregate keys we expanded. This helps us identify which aggregates are "active" (i.e., have
 *      received matching activities and have not expired). It also helps us identify expired aggregates, in which case we
 *      can delete all their aggregated data (status and entities).
 *
 *  4.  For all expired aggregates, delete their status entry and all their previously aggregated entities. For more information
 *      on expiry, see `_isExpired`.
 *
 *  5.  For all *active* aggregates, fetch all the aggregated entities that are stored for them. This ensures that the activities
 *      current history can carry forward when this aggregate is redelivered.
 *
 *  6.  Merge all the aggregates with their aggregated entities fetched in step #5, and identify which aggregates will be
 *      delivered as activities. Aggregates that will be delivered are determined by:
 *
 *          *   Identify which activities belong to "multi-aggregates". A multi-aggregate is an aggregate that has aggregated atleast
 *              two distinct activities. Merge the data and mark it to be delivered (i.e., the activity becomes "claimed"). In this
 *              case, the `lastActivity` id of the aggregate status is recorded so it may be deleted (because it was replaced with the
 *              updated aggregate)
 *          *   For all activities that weren't claimed by a multi-aggregate, identify the ones that belong to a "single-aggregate". A
 *              single-aggregate is an aggregate that only contains a single activity of data. The single-aggregate then becomes merged
 *              with the new activity. Merging the new activity with a single-aggregate will now make it a multi-aggregate if the new
 *              activity contains at least one entity that did not belong to the single-aggregate. The previous activity is deleted
 *              in the same way as with multi-aggregates
 *          *   Identify which activities do not belong to any active aggregate (no single- or multi-aggregate exists for it) and mark
 *              them to be delivered, but only once per route. This new aggregate is now a "single-aggregate" which can now claim a
 *              matching activity at the single-aggregate priority if a matching activity occurs within the expiry time
 *
 *  7.  Save all the new aggregate entities that were found in the collected batch of queued activities. This ensures that when
 *      the next activity comes along and matches those aggregates, that historical information is there to carry forward.
 *
 *  8.  Iterate over all the aggregates that are marked for delivery, and generate the activity object based on their aggregated
 *      entities and metadata (publish date, verb, activityType, etc...)
 *
 *  9.  Persist the new activities to their routes
 *
 *  10. Delete all the activities that were being tracked as active aggregates. We recorded which activities need to be deleted
 *      during step #6
 *
 *  11. Update the status of all aggregates. At the very least to indicate they were just touched by an activity. For aggregates that
 *      actually resulted in a delivered activity, they will also be given a `lastActivity` id that will be used to delete the
 *      activity we just delivered if a new activity matches the aggregate
 *
 *  12. Delete the queued activities that we just processed so that they don't get reprocessed.

                         *
                         * Here we choose which aggregates need to be wrapped up into an activity and delivered to the activity stream. This is
                         * rather difficult to get right. These are the rules implemented below:
                         *
                         *  For a given activity:
                         *
                         *  1.  If a matching multi-aggregate exists for an activity, it will "claim" the activity for that stream and redeliver
                         *      the updated aggregate, while deleting the old version of the activity. If more than one multi-aggregate matches
                         *      the activity, all matching multi-aggregates are redelivered. This is to support the situation where:
                         *
                         *          Aggregate #1: "Branden followed Simon and Bert"
                         *          Aggregate #2: "Nicolaas and Stuart followed Stephen"
                         *
                         *      Now, when Branden follows Stephen, both of those "multi-aggregates" will claim this activity, as such:
                         *
                         *          Aggregate #1': "Branden followed Simon, Bert and Stephen"
                         *          Aggregate #2': "Nicolaas, Stuart and Branden followed Stephen"
                         *
                         * 2.   For all activities that haven't been claimed, if a single-aggregate exists for an activity, it will "claim" the
                         *      activity for that stream and redeliver the updated aggregate, while deleting the old version of the activity. If
                         *      more than one single-aggregate matches the activity, all matching single-aggregates are redelivered. This is to
                         *      support the situation where:
                         *
                         *          Aggregate #1: "Branden followed Simon"
                         *          Aggregate #2: "Nicolaas followed Stephen"
                         *
                         *      Now, when Branden followed Stephen, both of those "single-aggregates" will claim this activity and become "multi-
                         *      aggregates", as such:
                         *
                         *          Aggregate #1: "Branden followed Simon and Stephen"
                         *          Aggregate #2: "Nicolaas and Branden followed Stephen"
                         *
                         * 3.   An activity is only delivered for an inactive aggregate if the activity was not "claimed" for the route by an
                         *      active single- or multi-aggregate. This would make sure that we don't redeliver an active aggregate, AND deliver
                         *      a new single-aggregate (e.g., "Branden shared Syllabus with OAE Team") for the same route.
                         *
                         * 4.   If no active aggregates claim an activity, and there are multiple inactive aggregates (e.g., the activity type has
                         *      multiple "pivot points"), then one single activity is delivered for all of them. This is necessary to ensure that
                         *      the "lastActivityId" is recorded properly for both aggregates, so if either of those inactive aggregates become
                         *      active later (i.e., another activity comes along and matches it), the previous activity can be properly deleted by
                         *      either of the aggregates.
