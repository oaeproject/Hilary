/**
 * Indexes domains so that suffix-matching can be efficiently performed. An entry can be add to
 * the index which is keyed by a domain (e.g., `cam.ac.uk`) and the value must be some string
 * value (e.g., a tenant alias). When indexed, the following operations can be performed
 * efficiently:
 *
 *  * The index will ensure no domains can be set that are a prefix or a descendent of another
 *    domain already in the index. Therefore, if `cam.ac.uk` is set, the index will guarantee that
 *    `uk.ac` cannot be set (it is a prefix) and that `caret.cam.ac.uk` cannot be set (it is a
 *    descendant)
 *  * `match` - Given a domain, the index can efficiently locate a unique prefix that exists in the
 *    index. For example, if key -> value of `cam.ac.uk` -> `"cam"` is set in the index, then
 *    looking for a match on `cam.ac.uk` or `caret.cam.ac.uk` will both return the value `"cam"`.
 *    However matching `ac.uk` will return nothing, as matching *only* matches on prefixes that
 *    exist in the index
 *  * `conflict` - Given a domain, the index can efficiently test whether or not the domain will be
 *    able to be set as a key in the index. A domain can be set if the `match` operation returns no
 *    results, AND if there are no descendants of the domain. E.g., if `cam.ac.uk` exists, then all
 *    of `ca.uk`, `cam.ac.uk` and `caret.cam.ac.uk` would result in a conflict with `cam.ac.uk`
 *  * `update` - Provides the ability to efficiently set an email domain in the index to a string
 *    value. Once set, all subsequent attempts to set a domain that is a suffix or descendant of the
 *    domain will result in a conflict
