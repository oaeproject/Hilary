/**
 * Get a propagation specification that is standard for a resource. This effectively assumes that a resource does not get
 * propagated to those who do not have implicit or explicit access, therefore they will not be on the propagation list. For
 * explicit membership to be recognized here, the resource type (e.g., content, discussion) must have an association registered
 * called 'members'. If it doesn't, then private unjoinable resources will not be routed to anyone, not even their members.
 *
 * This method is not suitable, for example, in situations where a resource has a "scrubbing" mechanism that makes it acceptable
 * for it to be propagated to unprivileged users. One example is 'user', where users are propagated to *all* routes even if they
 * are private, as the transformer will scrub sensitive information during the transformation phase.
