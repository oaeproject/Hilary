/**
 * Selectively reprocess content previews.
 * A valid request will test each content and/or revision against the provided filters. All the filters are ANDed together and
 * only those content items who pass all the `content_*` filters will be selected. Further more if you've
 * specified any `revision_*` filters, only the revisions that match these revisions will be selected for reprocessing.
 *
 * It's strongly recommended that you be as specific as possible as this is not a light-weight operation.
 *
 * A filter which allow for multiple values (ex: filtering based on mime) will check if the content/revision item matches against
 * one of the provided values.

 * @param  {String[]}       filters.content_resourceSubType     Filter content based on its resourceSubType. Possible values are any combination of `file`, `link`, or `collabdoc`
 * @param  {String[]}       filters.content_previewsStatus      Filter content based on the preview processing status. Possible values are any combination of `error`, `ignored`, `pending` or `done`
 * @param  {String[]}       filters.revision_mime               Filter based on the mime type of a file. Only useful in combination with `content_resourceSubType: file`
