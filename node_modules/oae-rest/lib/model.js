/**
 * REST Context object used to represent a tenant on which a REST request is done, as well as
 * the user creditentials of the user performing the action.
 *
 * @param  {String}     host                    The URL of the tenant on which the request is done. This should include the protocol (e.g. http://gt.oae.com) and should not have a trailing slash.
 * @param  {Object}     [opts]                  Optional parameters for the request
 * @param  {String}     [opts.username]         The username of the user performing the REST request. This should be null if the current user is anonymous
 * @param  {String}     [opts.userPassword]     The password of the user performing the REST request. This should be null if the current user is anonymous
 * @param  {String}     [opts.hostHeader]       The host header that should be sent on the REST request. This can be set to avoid having to set up the actual hosts on a development environment. When this is set, the host should be the direct URL to the tenant express server
 * @param  {String}     [opts.refererHeader]    The referer header that should be sent on the REST request. By default it will be set as the target host of the request
 * @param  {Boolean}    [opts.strictSSL]        Whether or not the server is using a valid SSL certificate. If `true`, any attempts to connect to the REST endpoints using an invalid certificate should result in an error and not be ignored. If `false`, a valid certificate will not be required. By default, this will be set to `true`
