 * - The column family AuthzMembers will keep resource ids (groups, content, etc.) as its row keys
 * and will have a column for each of the principals (users and groups) the resource is associated
 * to
 * - The column family AuthzMembershipsCache will keep a cache of all of the direct and indirect
 * memberships for a principal, used to do permission checks. This will be invalidated every time
 * one of these groups is updated
 * - The column family AuthzMembershipsIndirectCache holds a cache of only groups that a principal
 * is strictly a member of indirectly. Meaning, if a user is a member both directly and indirectly,
 * the group will not be a part of indirect cache
