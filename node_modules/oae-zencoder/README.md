#The Zencoder module for OAE.

To use this module with your own Zencoder account, please add the following to the main Hilary config.js file:
- your Zencoder API key;
- your S3 bucket name, region, access key, and secret key.

You should also configure your S3 bucket policy to accept requests from Zencoder; the instructions on how to do this and an example bucket policy can be found [here](https://app.zencoder.com/docs/guides/getting-started/working-with-s3). For any other information on Zencoder, including instructions on how to open an account, you can visit [their website](https://zencoder.com/en/).
