// ASSOCIATIONS //
//////////////////

/**
 * An association session is an object that can be used to access associations that are registered for activity entities by
 * type (see ActivityAPI#registerActivityEntityAssociation for more information). During the lifetime of the session, any
 * access to associations for an entity will become cached, such that subsequent calls will not make perform expensive
 * operations multiple times. This is important during the routing phase of activities since it is common for this to
 * happen.
 *
 * # Example
 *
 * ```javascript
 *  var associationsSession = new AssociationSession(ActivityRegistry.getRegisteredActivityEntityAssociations(), actor, object, target);
 *  var associationsContext = associationsSession.createAssociationsContext(actor.objectType, actor.id);
 *  associationsContext.get('followers', function(err, followers) {
 *      if (err) {
 *          return callback(err);
 *      }
 *
 *      _.each(followers, ...);
 *      ...
 *  });
 * ```
 *
 * @param  {Object}                 registeredAssociations  All the associations that are registered to the activity API as per ActivityRegistry#getRegisteredActivityEntityAssociations
 * @param  {Object}                 actor                   The persistent actor entity, as created by the entity producer
 * @param  {Object}                 object                  The persistent object entity, as created by the entity producer
 * @param  {Object}                 target                  The persistent target entity, as created by the entity producer
